My personal motivator

This repository is public, but the app
is developed for myself, adjusted to my
likings and my personal taste.

It is also a kind of a diary, where I improve myself
while improving the app.

# App
Uses `gpt-4o` under the hood.

## Plan
Plan the schedule for the upcoming week
using two inputs for different types of tasks.

## Adjust
Adjust the plan after the given time point.

## Summarise
Analyze my behaviour and create a summary
guide for how to create the schedule.

Wished result: The schedule will become better
and better from week to week.

# Downsides
First week needed a lot of adjustments,
the model told me to wake up at 7am,
ignored some of my tasks and so on...

However after adjusting it (~1 hour)
the model gave me a pretty good timetable
which I am pretty comfortable with.
