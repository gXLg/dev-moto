My personal motivator

This repository is public, but the app
is developed for myself, adjusted to my
likings and my personal taste.

It is also a kind of a diary, where I improve myself
while improving the app.

# App
Tracks my personal skills and my mental health status.

* Basic Skills: Such as concentration ability, discipline etc.
* Targeted Skills: Skills based on things
  I learn in the university, my hobbies or job.
* Status: Such as sleep, motivation etc.
